Entity Movement and Interaction Test Map
1 - test 1: make sure entities (player in this case) can't go out of bounds
2 - test 2: does log turn as you push it to the right?
3 - test 3: does sideways log roll when you push it?
4 - test 4: does turning log only go uphill when it's standing?
5 - test 5: does rolling log only go downhill?
6 - test 6: general test for rolling log around 
    (rdrur is log movements, should end up against right-most rock)
7 - test 7: pushing logs off a cliff onto other logs
    (should try to push sideways, combine with vertical, rest atop standing)
8 - test 8: pushing logs over other logs
    (standing log and vertical log should just combine, rolling should roll
    across, but one stops early, hits a rock, and combines)
    (also the rolling log should roll across a raft without sailing)
9 - test 9: rafting general
    (if something atop an entity on top of water tries to move and fails, it
    will try to make that entity move in the opposite direction. the 4 smaller
    components lined up are:
    a. push up while on raft to go down
    b. same, but make sure that there are no problems with being between rocks
    c. push up on nothing should give no movement
    d. push up while on log gives no movement)
A - test 10: can the player knock over a tree and use it to climb up layers?
B - test 11: correct player movement across water logs
    (rdlldrdrrrdddldl is player movements, should end up in bottom left)
C - test 12: can the player correctly ascend/descend the terrain?
    (rrrdddlllururrdludlr is player movements, should end up in central hole)
D - test 13: pushing stuff on top of rafts
    (if the player pushes a standing log atop a raft, the raft should sail
    over, before the log tries to fall over onto the new land)
E - test 14: are log-to-log pushing interactions handled correctly?
    (if the player starts by pushing right, then the whole stack should be
    pushed right. effectively, each case will say "the next thing should move
    out of the way, and then i'll move in if there's space", queueing its
    movement behind the next thing moving first
    this should also work for the other "stacked up" types, but other two
    should not be able to move)

test 15: make sure the stack wasn't destroyed. should be the same as start!
