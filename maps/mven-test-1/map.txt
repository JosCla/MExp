1: Big log stack mven queueing test
So, the "player ledge", viewed from the side, looks like:
    ^^^^
    p*^^
    ..*^
    ..*^
    ..*^^^^r
    ........
And, after the player pushes off the first log,
  the logs should "cascade" their rolling, eventually settling as:
    ..^^
    ..^^
    ..^****r
    ........
The bottom portion of the island is just to let the player raft to island 2.

2: Push off rolling log to raft
The player should stand on the island to the left of the rolling log, and
  push on the rolling log, simultaneously rafting left and letting the log
  roll right.

3: Push rolling log on raft
The single raft at this island has a vertical log on it. Pushing it right
  should cause the raft to sail off to the right, with the rolling log atop it,
  before then stopping at island 2, and letting the rolling log roll off.
