Test 1: No out-of-bounds
    Take the rafts in the upper-left and lower-right corners, and try to push
    them out of bounds. Ensure that they stay in place.
Test 2: Rolling log rolls
    Push the rolling log once right, ensure that it hits the rock on the right,
    and stops.
Test 3: Standing/Vertical log tips
    Push the standing log right, ensure that it is now a vertical log.
    Then push the vertical log right, ensure that it is now a standing log.
Test 4: Rolling log only rolls downhill
    Push the rolling log once right, ensure that it stops in the little valley.
Test 5: Standing/Vertical log can go uphill
    Push the standing/vertical right, ensure that both forms can go up slopes
    with height 1. Then, once the log is in the valley, push it left and right
    to ensure that both forms can't go up slopes with height greater than one.
Test 6: Log movement interactions
    Push the rolling log right. It should knock the standing log into another
    rolling log, that rolls into a standing log, and gets blocked.
Test 7: Log rolling across other logs
    Push the rolling log right. It should roll across the vertical logs, that
    are all sitting one layer below in the water, stopping at the rock.
Test 8: Pushing a standing log off a ledge onto other logs
    It should balance atop the standing log, roll over the rolling log, and
    get blocked by the vertical log.
Test 9: Standing log is two tall
    The rolling log, despite being at a higher elevation than the standing log,
    should still stop upon rolling into it, since the standing log is two tall.
