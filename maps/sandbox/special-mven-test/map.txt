Test 1: Tall raft
    Even if there are several items stacked on a raft on water, you can still
    raft around while atop all of it
Test 2: Complex raft push
    The raft on the left has the player on it, the raft on the right has a
    rolling log on it (vertical as we see it)
    When the player pushes right, the two rafts should depart oppositely,
    and when the right raft reaches the shore, the log on it should roll off
    (This is mainly to test that complex movement queueing works)
Test 3: Normal-T and Inverse-T
    Pushing a standing log onto a standing log should produce a normal-T.
    Pushing a vertical log onto a vertical log should produce an inverse-T.
Test 4: Lean a log onto the raft
    The player should be able to tip a standing log onto a raft
Test 5: Push over a stuck raft
    The player should be able to push a log over the stuck raft as if it was
    land
Test 6: Player and rolling logs
    The player should not be able to move on or off of rolling logs in water
    (Can't move from right-to-left nor left-to-right log, and can't move from
    right log onto land)
Test 7: Pushing stuff from rolling logs
    Even if you can't move off a rolling log, you can still push stuff from it
    (Left log in water, right log on land. Stand on left, can push right)
Test 8: Tree versus standing log
    If you push a standing log into a tree (right-to-left), neither should
    fall over.
    If you push a tree into a standing log (left-to-right), both should fall
    over.
Test 9: The player shouldn't be able to walk into the water
    Surprise!
Test A: Ladder
    The player should be able to climb laddered tiles
    (and other stuff shouldn't)
Test B: Pushing log underneath stack
    If a vertical log is underneath a stack of other items, then upon tilting
    the log up to a standing log, the other items should increase their height
    accordingly.
