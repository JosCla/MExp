Tests:
1: CENT update
    Upon moving the standing log twice right...
    Its X and Y in CENT should update, and nothing else.
2: EPOS update
    Upon moving the standing log twice right...
    The old position (and intermediary pos) should have an EPOS of 0,
        and the new position should have a nonzero EPOS.
3: Stack movement (CENT)
    Upon moving the bottom of the stack twice right...
    Both the entity and the one on top should have CENT X and Y update.
4: Partial stack movement (CENT)
    Upon moving something in the middle of the stack...
    Only entities above it should have been moved.
5: Stack movement (EPOS) (consolidated into island 3)
    Upon moving the bottom of the stack twice right...
    The old position (and intermediary pos) should have an EPOS of 0,
6: Partial stack movement (EPOS) (consolidated into island 4)
    Upon moving something in the middle of the stack...
    The old position and new position should have a nonzero EPOS,
        and the intermediary position should have an EPOS of 0.
7: Height movement
    Upon moving the standing log onto the upper ledge...
    Its X, Y, and Z in CENT should all be correctly updated
8: Height movement (stack)
    Upon moving the full stack onto the upper ledge...
    All stack entities should have their Z correctly changed.
9: Between-island movement
    Upon moving the entity from one island to another... (marked by *)
    It should now be owned by the other island.
A: Between-island movement (stack)
    Upon moving the stack from one island to another... (marked by *)
    The full stack should now be owned by the other island.
B: Moving onto other island owned entities
    Upon moving the standing log onto a raft owned by another island...
    The log should now be owned by the other island as well.
F: Player island
    (just something for the player to stand on)

(also test that the stack isn't destroyed through any of this!)
