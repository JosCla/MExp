Test 1: Basic raft combination
    Push the left log into the right one, and you get a raft!
Test 2: Standing log doesn't roll over
    This should also make a raft. The left log, a standing log, should
    not fully roll over the right log, a rolling log.
Test 3: Roll over raft
    A rolling log should roll straight across a vertical log, rather than
    becoming a raft with it.
Test 4: Roll to stop to raft
    If a rolling log stops on top of a vertical log, however, it should
    combine with it to form a raft.
Test 5: Stack onto raft
    If a raft combination happens, then anything on top of the log absorbed
    into the raft should end up directly on top of the raft.
Test 6: Land raft
    If a standing log tries to roll over a rolling log and fails half-way
    through, the two should combine into a raft.
Test 7: Land raft (part 2)
    If a rolling log stops rolling across a vertical log, it should also
    combine into a raft.
Test 8: Lie on a standing log
    If a log stops on top of a standing log, it should not combine into a
    raft. I wanna keep that cool bridge-building behavior!
