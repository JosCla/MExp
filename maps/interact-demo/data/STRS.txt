Welcome to the
islands!
  
Press [ENTER] to
continue.

Walk
around with the
arrow keys and
press [2ND] to
reset an island.

Have fun, and
don't forget to
hug the
snowfolk!


Here's another
sign. It should
contain
different text
from the first
one. It should
also naturally
insert page
breaks when the
text gets too
long. However,
it would be good
practice for me
to insert those
manually as
well. Like...
this!

Like that.

Awesome. That
should work
swimmingly.

It's just a
shame that long
words tend to
create big
newlines!
