Test 1: Push logs into water
    If you push rolling into water, it rolls in then stops
    If you push standing into water, it becomes vertical
    If you push vertical into water, it stays vertical
Test 2: Rafting motion
    If the player is on a raft, and they push left, they should sail right,
    stopping at the opposite rock
Test 3: Rafting force
    Rafting should only go through if the push has sufficient "force"
    Player directly pushing has maximum "force", while a log rolling has
    minimum "force", to give an example
Test 4: Raft stop
    The raft, upon sailing, should stop at other objects
Test 5: Push a thing on a raft
    There is a rolling log on top of the raft. When the player pushes it, it
    should defer the movement to the underlying raft, and when the raft
    eventually reaches the other side, it should then let the log roll off
Test 6: Force of thing pushed on raft
    It's the same as the previous test, but just making sure when the log tries
    to roll off, it can't push the raft back (too low force)
Test 7: More raft "backboards"
    If the player tries to perform a "push then move" off a raft, then the push
    should go through, but the move is deferred to raft sailing
    But, if the player just tries to move off the raft, nothing to push, then
    they should just move off the raft.
Test 8: Player trying to move on water
    The player should not be able to walk on water. However, if there is a
    vertical log or a raft (not a rolling log!), they should be good to move
    on those, even if they're on water.
Test 9: Fail to move but don't raft
    If the player tries to move off a raft onto a rolling log, they should
    not be able to move, but they should also not raft away.
