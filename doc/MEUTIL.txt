Lbl CPRV {
    .Just the Copy() command but copies bytes in reverse order
    .(Good for copying a portion of memory to an overlapping portion
    .  that's forwards in memory)
    .r1: Base memory address (source)
    .r2: Base memory address (target)
    .r3: Number of bytes to copy
    .(returns nothing)

    For(G,1,r_3)
        {r_1+r_3-G}->{r_2+r_3-G}
    End
