.Test 1: Basic raft combination
.    Push the left log into the right one, and you get a raft!
GCEP(1,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(1,1)->A
GCEP(1,2)->B
ASRT(A<CE?CE-A=(B-CE)?{B}=6?{B+1}=2)

.Test 2: Standing log doesn't roll over
.    This should also make a raft. The left log, a standing log, should
.    not fully roll over the right log, a rolling log.
GCEP(2,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(2,1)->A
GCEP(2,2)->B
ASRT(A<CE?{B}=6?{B+1}=2)

.Test 3: Roll over raft
.    A rolling log should roll straight across a vertical log, rather than
.    becoming a raft with it.
GCEP(3,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(3,1)->A
GCEP(3,2)->B
ASRT(A>CE?{A+1}=3?{B+1}=2?{A}=4?{B}=3)

.Test 4: Roll to stop to raft
.    If a rolling log stops on top of a vertical log, however, it should
.    combine with it to form a raft.
GCEP(4,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(4,1)->A
GCEP(4,2)->B
GCEP(4,3)->C
ASRT(A<CE?{B}=3?{C}=5?{C+1}=3)

.Test 5: Stack onto raft
.    If a raft combination happens, then anything on top of the log absorbed
.    into the raft should end up directly on top of the raft.
GCEP(5,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(5,1)->A
GCEP(5,2)->B
GCEP(5,3)->C
ASRT(A<CE?{C}=6?{B+5}=2)

.Test 6: Land raft
.    If a standing log tries to roll over a rolling log and fails half-way
.    through, the two should combine into a raft.
GCEP(6,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(6,1)->A
GCEP(6,2)->B
ASRT(A<CE?{B}=6)

.Test 7: Land raft (part 2)
.    If a rolling log stops rolling across a vertical log, it should also
.    combine into a raft.
GCEP(7,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(7,1)->A
GCEP(7,2)->B
ASRT(A<CE?{B}=5)

.Test 8: Lie on a standing log
.    If a log stops on top of a standing log, it should not combine into a
.    raft. I wanna keep that cool bridge-building behavior!
GCEP(8,1)->A
Return!If A
MVEF(A,1,0,1)
GCEP(8,1)->A
GCEP(8,2)->B
ASRT(A>CE?{A}=3?{B}=1?{A+5}=3)

.Test 9: Stack Correctness
