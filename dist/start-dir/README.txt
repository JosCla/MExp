===============================================================================
Welcome to MExp!
===============================================================================

MExp is a simplified calculator remake of A Monster's Expedition, an open-world
puzzling adventure by Draknek & Friends. Push, roll, and tumble logs to
traverse the world and navigate from puzzle to puzzle!


===============================================================================
Installation
===============================================================================

MExp is available for TI-83/84 series calculators with black-and-white screens.

After downloading and unzipping MExp.zip, you will need to send two files to
your calculator: 
- MExp.8xk: This is the application itself.
- MEXPWORL.8xv: This is the world file that the application runs. **Make sure
  to send it to archive, and not RAM!**

Once you have sent both files to your calculator, press {APPS} to open the
Applications menu, find MExp, and press {ENTER} to start!


===============================================================================
How to Play
===============================================================================

Move around and explore the world!

Controls:
- Arrows: Move
- {2ND}: Reset puzzle
- {ALPHA}: Undo move
- {CLEAR}: Exit game

If you're having trouble, you can press + and - to skip forward and backward
through puzzles. These "cheat controls" will never be required for any puzzle! 

If you move toward a sign, you will read it. Press {ENTER} to advance the text.

At the end of the area, you will be given a password that lets you unlock the
zip folder titled `locked.zip`.
